        help
            If enabled, notification service will verify WiFi connectivity before
            sending webhooks. This prevents wasting resources on failed HTTP requests
            when device is offline.

            If disabled, notification service will attempt to send regardless of WiFi
            status and let the HTTP client fail naturally.
